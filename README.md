# KPrefs: pref like a winnerâ„¢!

A very small library (~400 loc) for Android/Kotlin to remove
shared preferences boilerplate.

_This is a much lighter, Kotlin specific, followup to my [Prefs lib](https://github.com/BoD/android-prefs)
which was annotation processor based whereas this one is
Kotlin delegates based._

## Usage
### 1/ Add the dependencies to your project

```groovy
dependencies {
    /* ... */
    implementation 'org.jraf:kprefs:1.2.0'
}
```
_(The artifact is hosted on jcenter)_

### 2/ Define your preferences
Create a `Prefs` instance and pass it a `Context`.  Optionally pass it
a `fileName`, and a `fileMode`.

```kotlin
class MainPrefs(context: Context) {
        private val prefs = Prefs(context)
        
        (...)
```

Then declare your `val`s or `var`s using delegates on the `prefs` object:

```kotlin
    var login by prefs.String()

    var password by prefs.String(Key(KEY_PASSWORD))
    val passwordLiveData by prefs.StringLiveData(Key(KEY_PASSWORD))
    val passwordFlow by prefs.StringFlow(Key(KEY_PASSWORD))

    var premium by prefs.Boolean(false)
    var age by prefs.Int()
    var preferredColor by prefs.Int(0xFF0000)
    var weekDays by prefs.StringSet(setOf("Friday", "Saturday"))
```

Currently, the available types are:
- Boolean
- Float
- Integer
- Long
- String
- StringSet

ðŸ‘‰ If you pass a `default` value, the attribute type will be non nullable.<br>
In the example above, `age` is `Int?` whereas `preferredColor` is `Int`.

ðŸ‘‰ Optionally pass a `key` parameter, which will be used
to store the preference.  By default the attribute name is used.

### 3/ Be a winner!
Simply use your class like this:
```kotlin
    private val mainPrefs by lazy { MainPrefs(this) }
    (...)
    
    // Get a preference
    val login = mainPrefs.login
    
    // Put a preference
    mainPrefs.password = "p4Ssw0Rd"
    
    // Observe a preference, with LiveData
    mainPrefs.passwordLiveData.observe(this, Observer {
        log("observed password=$it")
    })

    // Observe a preference, with Flow
    mainPrefs.passwordFlow.onEach {
        Log.d(TAG, "observed password=$it")
    }.launchIn(scope)
```
